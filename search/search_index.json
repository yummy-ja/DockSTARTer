DockSTARTer comes with configurations to run various apps. DockSTARTer can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus. DockSTARTer can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI. DockSTARTer is here to give you the freedom to choose what you want to run. DockSTARTer allows you to run apps that are not included using Overrides / Introduction . What DockSTARTer Is Not DockSTARTer is not a pre-made set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it). DockSTARTer does not configure apps for you (think of it more like installing apps as a service, settings inside the app are still up to you, although our documentation will have recommendations). DockSTARTer does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc). System Requirements Supported Operating Systems You must be running a Supported Platform or an operating system based on a supported platform. Platforms named below will link to documentation listing compatible versions. CentOS Debian Fedora Ubuntu Any operating system based on one of the above (ex: Raspbian) should also work as long as you can install the officially supported script . DockSTARTer will attempt to perform this install for you if possible. Supported Hardware Any x86_64 , armv7l , or aarch64 system should be able to run one of the supported operating systems listed above. ARM CPUs may have a limited selection of supported containers.

Min: Backs up your .env file Med: Backs up your .env file and the config folder for any enabled app Max: Backs up your .env file and any config folder found in your DOCKERCONFDIR. Apps will be stopped before running a backup and started after completing a backup. Med and Max also support pre/post commands in between each app (so you could disable uptime monitors for example) Min, Med, and Max support pre/post commands for the entire run. These commands can be set in .env Scheduling backups It is recommended to setup a cron job using sudo crontab -e and adding a line like 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b min or 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b med or 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b max Which would make a daily backup at 2 AM. Backup retention The snapshot backup is created into ${BACKUP_CONFDIR}/<appname>.001 . If the folder <appname>.001 exists already it is rotated to <appname>.002 and so on, up to <appname>.512 by default (this can be adjusted), thereafter it is removed. So if you create one backup per night, for example with a cronjob, then this retention policy gives you 512 days of retention. This is useful but this can require to much disk space, that is why we have included a non-linear distribution policy. In short, we keep only the oldest backup in the range 257-512, and also in the range 129-256, and so on. This exponential distribution in time of the backups retains more backups in the short term and less in the long term; it keeps only 10 or 11 backups but spans a retention of 257-512 days. In the following table you can see on each column the different steps of the rotation, where each column shows the current set of snapshots (limited from <appname>.1 to <appname>.16 in this example): 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 16 To save more disk space, rsync will make hard links for each file of <appname>.001 that already existed in <appname>.002 with identical content, timestamps and ownerships. Deleting backups Backups created by DockSTARTer will be protected with a special attribute called immutable that makes the backups read only to all users including root. This is done to protect your backups from accidental deletion. Backups will be rotated through retention as described above because the backup script handles the immutable attribute. If you need to delete a backup manually you will first need to remove the immutable attribute from the folder using sudo chattr -R -i /path/to/backup/<appname>.### Credits The backup function is strongly borrowed from http://www.pointsoftware.ch/en/howto-local-and-remote-snapshot-backup-using-rsync-with-hard-links/ which has sections explaining how the rsync process works, including information about hard links (backups don't take up as much space as you think!)","title":"Backups"},{"location":"advanced/backups/#backups","text":"","title":"Backups"},{"location":"advanced/backups/#this-is-deprecated-and-removed-from-dockstarter-as-of-01012020","text":"","title":"THIS IS DEPRECATED AND REMOVED FROM DOCKSTARTER AS OF 01/01/2020"},{"location":"advanced/backups/#creating-backups","text":"DockSTARTer menu has an option for Backup Config , or you can use one of sudo ds -b min / sudo ds -b med / sudo ds -b max to create backups.

Motivation There are a few different types of Docker networks. DockSTARTer by default uses a 'bridge' network, which is a virtual network that provides isolation from other networks, but allows containers to communicate with each other. However, some applications require access to the physical network. Both Home Assistant and Plex need physical network access for discovery (the former will have issues communicating with IoT devices otherwise). One solution might be to use Docker's host network. This however, increases the odds of port conflicts as more containers are added. Docker introduced a Macvlan network for this case which assigns a unique IP and MAC address for attached containers. Setup On Your Router Take note of the IP address of your Docker host and create a DHCP reservation for the IP if there isn't one already. Configure DHCP so it will not assign address in a given range. That range will be occupied by our container's addresses. The rest of this tutorial assumes addresses above X.X.X.190 will be free. On Your Docker Host Create the macvlan network (see Note 1): docker network create -d macvlan -o parent = <myinterface> --subnet X.X.X.0/24 --gateway X.X.X.1 --ip-range X.X.X.192/27 --aux-address 'host=X.X.X.Y' mymacvlan <myinterface> is the network interface your device is receiving data from. Run ifconfig for a listing of possible -nterfaces. Ex: eth0 subnet and gateway are specific to your LAN subnet ip-range is the range in which Docker will assign IP addresses. This example goes from X.X.X.192 to X.X.X.223 X.X.X.Y following host should be the IP address of your Docker host. Add the following to /etc/network/interfaces after replacing information as needed: # Create new macvlan interface on the host ip link add mymacvlanshim link myinterface type macvlan mode bridge # Add the host address and bring up the interface ip addr add X.X.X.Y/32 dev mymacvlanshim ip link set mymacvlanshim up # Tell our host to use that interface to communicate with containers ip route add 192 .168.86.192/27 dev mymacvlanshim Reboot Note 1 You may be wondering why we don't create the network in Docker compose. Newer versions of compose have issues with using aux-address and ip-range . In Your DockSTARTer Overrides We could connect our containers to mymacvlan and call it a day, but it's very useful to reserve IPs for each container so we can reach web endpoints in a consistent way. Add something similar to this to your docker-compose.override.yml file for each container: services : ouroboros : networks : composemacvlan : ipv4_address : X.X.X.201 networks : composemacvlan : external : name : mymacvlan The ipv4 address should fall in the range you reserved. Unfortunately, it's necessary to do this when adding new containers if you want them on the same network. After this, you should be able to compose ( sudo ds -c ) and have a new shiny macvlan network!

DS staff have tested and confirmed the following installation method on OMV version 5.5. If you are a Linux newbie, we strongly discourage this approach because of all the issues that might arise with how OMV is built, and troubleshooting issues in OMV can be a pain. However, if you feel comfortable with Linux and want to continue down this route you will need to ensure the following: You have installed all the necessary updates that are pending in your system. You have set a DNS server in your Web GUI. You have created a user with a home directory outside of the system disk that has sudo and ssh permissions. See below in how to do that. You have a secondary disk other than the system drive mounted and formatted to anything other than NTFS. We recommend you set up a specific \"Shared Folder\" for your home directory. appdata directory should only be used to store container configurations, not home directories. SSH to your host as root. You will need to edit a system config file in order to avoid issues in the future. Run the following command (you can use your favorite text editor for this portion): nano /etc/openmediavault/config.xml We are looking for the following line: <opts>defaults,nofail,user_xattr,noexec,usrjquota=aquota.user,grpjquota=aquota.group,jqfmt=vfsv0,acl... The part you care about is the noexec bit. You will need to remove that string. Save the file and per OMV documentation you need to run omv-salt deploy run fstab . To verify that the noexec flag was removed from your drive run cat /proc/mounts and find your drive on the list. You can also run cat /proc/mounts | grep partial_drive_name . If the noexec flag is present, you skipped a step. We are now going to work on creating the directories for DS to use. You will need to create 4 shared folders and allow \"Everyone read/write\". The 4 directories will be called appdata , storage , medialibrary and home . The last directory should be where you store your user directories and you should not be using the system disk for that. If you do not know how to create a user and assign it a home directory; look up the OMV documentation as that is outside of the scope of this guide. Once the above requirements have been met, you will need to SSH to your OMV host using the account you created. First make sure your home directory was set up correctly by typing cd ~ . This shouldn't return an error, if it does read over the OMV documentation in how to properly create a user with a home directory. If no error occurs, run the following commands: sudo apt-get install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://get.dockstarter.com)\" sudo reboot After the reboot is complete, SSH back to your host using your user account and run ds , type your password and select \"Configuration\".

A linux \"pro\" might use Compose to do what DockSTARTer does themselves but it would still take a lot longer. Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. To learn more about Compose refer to the following documentation . Compose works by reading YAML (*.yml) configuration files with the paths, ports and parameters each Container should run with. YML Files DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY. Overriding these settings is easy but you must create a new file first. See the Overrides / Introduction page. YML files are akin to XML files and below is an example: services : sonarr : image : containers_author/sonarr container_name : sonarr restart : ${SONARR_RESTART} environment : - PGID=${PGID} - PUID=${PUID} - TZ=${TZ} volumes : - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro - ${DOCKERCONFDIR}/sonarr:/config - ${DOCKERSTORAGEDIR}:/storage In the example above, image is the Container that you're using but also the quasi URL Docker will attempt to pull it from. container_name is the human readable name Docker will use to describe it. Volumes During the Getting Started section, you set volumes for your configuration, download and media etc in the GLOBAL section. The path to Sonarr's config in the above example, broken up, is ${DOCKERCONFDIR}/sonarr then the deliminator : followed by /config ${DOCKERCONFDIR}/sonarr is the path on your computer that Sonarr will see when it looks in /config . In this way, all your Containers will have their own private folder in your global config mount. The ${DOCKERSTORAGEDIR} location is public to all apps that need it. That means Sonarr will be writing and reading from the same ${DOCKERSTORAGEDIR}:/storage mounts as Radarr, SickBeard etc AND your download clients. Again , do not edit the default YML files, instead, see the section on Overrides / Introduction . (Assuming you are reading this page from start to finish for the first time) there is a reason you haven't seen their location yet ;) Ports The ports for access to (and from) your apps are manipulated in your .env settings. I use the Sonarr example a lot but if you're not familiar, it's default port is 8989 . SONARR_PORT_8989=6969 If you were to edit the .env for sonarr to the above, and run the generator again, you would then access Sonarr at http://app.address:6969/calendar instead of the default port, 8989. Do not change your apps internal ports unless you know what you are doing. For instance, if you change Sonarr's internal port to 4545, it will still listen on 8989 by default. So then, you won't be able to access the WebGUI and without that, I don't even know where to begin changing the port in Sonarr's config files.

Common Issue: Cannot Claim Server on First Run If you are starting the Plex container for the first time and cannot claim your server to set it up there are 3 methods you can try to resolve the issue: 1. Set the PLEX_CLAIM variable docker stop plex docker rm plex # removes the config folder for plex # !WARNING! do NOT do this if you have already setup your plex server and are having issues connecting to it, skip to option 3 instead rm -rf ~/.config/appdata/plex sudo nano ~/.docker/compose/.env # with the nano file editor open locate the PLEX_CLAIM variable # go to https://www.plex.tv/claim/ in your browser and get the claim token set your PLEX_CLAIM variable # the token expires in 5 minutes, so we'll want to get the rest done quickly # ctrl+x to save and exit nano ds -c up plex Then try again to claim the server by visiting http://yourserverip:32400/web/index.html 2. Host Network Mode If the first method does not work, edit your .env and set PLEX_NETWORK_MODE=host . Run ds -c and then attempt to claim your server. After claiming your server set PLEX_NETWORK_MODE= (back to blank). 3. Claim helper script If the first and second methods both have not worked this script should make it happen. docker exec -it plex /bin/bash # download the script curl -L -o plex-claim-server.sh https://github.com/uglymagoo/plex-claim-server/raw/master/plex-claim-server.sh # make the script executable chmod +x plex-claim-server.sh # go to https://www.plex.tv/claim/ in your browser and get the claim token and replace PLEX_CLAIM with this token in the next command, please use use the double quotes around your claim token ./plex-claim-server.sh \"PLEX_CLAIM\" # fix permissions chown abc:abc \"/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml\" # leave the container exit docker restart plex How To Run Plex Different Pass Versions Edit ~/.docker/compose/.env and set: PLEX_VERSION = plexpass Then run: ds -c up plex Rebuilding From Scratch Thankfully, some of this information is well documented (but not easily found) over on Plex's website here!

The first thing to setup is your domain and email settings in .docker/compose/.env under SWAG . Set the SWAG_EMAIL and SWAG_URL . If using subdomains ensure to add each subdomain to SWAG_SUBDOMAINS as each subdomain prefix (e.g. SWAG_SUBDOMAINS=portainer,deluge,pihole .

Command Line Switches Run The Install Script sudo ds -i This script does the following: Updates your system using apt-get Installs curl , git , grep , and sed (git should already be installed if you started with the install instructions on the main page, but it's here just in case) Installs docker - by downloading via the official docker-install script, used to run containers When the script finishes it will display a message informing you to reboot if this is the first time you've ran it. Run The Compose Generator sudo ds -c This script verifies the dependencies above and installs or updates them as needed, then creates a file ~/.docker/compose/docker-compose.yml based on the variables you configured in your ~/.docker/compose/.env file. The generator script will run your selected containers after creating the file. We encourage you to have a look at the generated docker-compose.yml file, however if you wish to make changes please consider using overrides. Please review the Technical Info and Overrides / Introduction pages. If you make any changes to your .env file (such as changing a port or enabling a new app) you need to rerun the generator which will rebuild only the affected containers. Update DockSTARTer sudo ds -u This should get you the latest changes to DockSTARTer. This will also backup and update your .env file. You may separately backup and update your .env file with the following command. sudo ds -e Then you may want to edit your .env file and run the generator again to bring up new apps or changes to existing apps. Setup Your Environment If you do not yet have a ~/.docker/compose/.env file: sudo ds -e Edit the file using something like nano ~/.docker/compose/.env (CTRL+X will prompt to save and exit the nano editor) Application Specific Variables Adding Apps You can add the variables required to run an app by running: sudo ds -a <APPNAME> ## Example: sudo ds -a sonarr Then your .env file fill have a variable named <APPNAME>_ENABLED that you can set to true and then run the Compose Generator to start the app. You may also need to fill in or adjust any other variables prefixed with the <APPNAME>_ that you're enabling. This is the best place to change the app's external default ports.

Relocating appdata For new installs the default DOCKERCONFDIR is ~/.config/appdata .

If you'd like to move your existing config to a new location you can do the following: Edit ~/. docker/compose/.env (in any text editor) and set DOCKERCONFDIR = ~/.config/appdata (You can choose anywhere to save configs, this example only shows the default location). Then run the following commands: ds -u ds -c down # Move your current config folder to the new location, ex: sudo mv ~/.docker/config ~/.config/appdata ds -c That's it!

Its official documentation should explain why but you can disable it if you want. Ouroboros will monitor (all or specified) running Docker containers and update them to the (latest or tagged) available image in the remote registry. Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same options that were used when it was deployed initially. In short, Ouroboros and Watchtower do the same thing: keeps your containers up to date. Ouroboros/Watchtower FAQ When I run ds -c and it recreates some of the containers, is that because they have had updates from last run With Ouroboros (or Watchtower) your containers will be updated to the latest images automatically. However, docker-compose has no idea what's updated, docker-compose keeps track of things independently from Ouroboros/Watchtower. Additionally, Ouroboros/Watchtower doesn't update docker-compose's method of tracking, therefore, compose might \"recreate\" containers that are already up to date. This is not a big deal it's basically just a container restart, and you were planning on running ds -c expecting some kind of updates anyway. General troubleshooting help You can see the (quite helpful) logs of each container with the docker logs <appname> command. Additionally, you can also use Dozzle if you prefer to view logs using your browser. Reported Issues Creating network \"compose_default\" with the default driver ERROR: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network This error can occur if your connected to a VPN while setting up the containers. Simply temporarily disconnect your VPN connection until the containers have been created and then reconnect again. Starting containers and getting the following or a similar error message: \"listen udp 0.0.0.0:5353: bind: address already in use\" As you could probably guess this means an application (most likely Plex) is trying to use a port that is already in use. You can check which application it is with: sudo lsof -i :<myport> So in this example it would be: sudo lsof -i :5353 which will show you that Google Chrome is using the port you need.

Following the instructions above, all files in ~/.config/NzbDrone would be copied to ~/.config/appdata/sonarr . After starting the new Sonarr in Docker, modify the Root Folder settings to tell Sonarr where your files are. DockSTARTer maps the true location of your media folders to locations the container expects to see such as /tv in the case of Sonarr, so that is where you will set your root folder.

This is due to another service that has occupied that port disallowing DockSTARTer from installing a service on that port. Troubleshooting Methods As DockSTARTer will check and fail if another service is occupying the port, it is necessary to locate and deal with the conflict. One way is to locate the service currently occupying the port. You can do the following: # sudo netstat -ltunp | grep -w ':<port>' ## Example: sudo netstat -ltunp | grep -w ':8080' Once you locate the offending service then you can choose what to do. Resolutions/Solutions Example: If you have avahi-daemon installed this will conflict with udp/5353 port usage for iTunes in Plex if selected. This will cause the script to exit with an [ERROR] and a [FATAL]. One resolution is to change the port being bound during configuration. During configuration change the external port exposed from 5353 to 5354 (or another unused port) . This will resolve the conflict. Another resolution would be to remove the software that is in conflict. Again as the example above. If you are not using mDNS resolution then avahi-daemon would be unnecessary. Simply remove the package with apt remove avahi-daemon from the base server. This will remove the offending service and allow the port to be used by the Docker service.","title":"Port Conflicts"},{"location":"basics/port-conflicts/#port-conflicts","text":"","title":"Port Conflicts"},{"location":"basics/port-conflicts/#issueproblem","text":"During configuration the script exits with an error like the following: ERROR: for plex cannot start service plex: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint plex (5a4d78fd5ff6c4c1a978ef31): Error starting userland proxy: listen udp 0.0.0.0:5353: bind: address already in use ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project. 2019-02-13 17:38:19 [FATAL] Docker Compose failed.
